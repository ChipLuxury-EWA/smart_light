# SMART LIGHT
I built this iot POC named smart-light for a "shark style" contest at my previous workplace.

Part of my job was to replace non-working lights in the building.
To locate a non working light there were two ways, either the customer employee open a 'maintenance call' and maintenance technician get to the specific location or the technician was traveling in the building (shotting in the dark :laughing:) looking for a non working lights.

I made a detailed slides in hebrew about the process you can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRopR86a36WNtpBp3xErwjkQVIqfYHpZqmUdebFyGaEnHwE0MynC2w4VM2ROVWj1LFp4-oT6AAbyHNh/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000 "My google slide")


You can enjoy a video I made that show working POC:
